# Energy Forecasting
This repository code came from the work of [Mario Dagrada](https://github.com/madagra/energy-ts-analysis), special thanks for the help.

The repository consists of an energy forecasting model using XGboost. The dataset consists of hourly energy consumption rates in kWh for an industrial utility over a period of around 7 months, from July 2019 to January 2020.

The final model has an *forecasting horizon* (The number of time periods to forecast into the future) of 48 time periods which corresponds to 2 days ahead forecasting. 

# Details
Main techniques and terms used:
- Trend, Seasonality
- Stationary and Non-Stationary Time Series
- Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test
- Autocorrelation(ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation(PACF)
- Feature Engineering (lag features, standard time series features, endogenous features)
- XGBoost model with Bayesan hyperparameters optimization

The final model can be found inside ```model/```

# Usage
The Jupyter-Notebook, dataset and model were saved as Docker Image in GitHub Package.
You can install the package locally:
```
docker pull docker.pkg.github.com/danieldacosta/energy-forecast/energy-forecast_notebook:v1
```

You can also download it direct from the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/DanielDaCosta/energy-forecast.git
```
